ABOUT THE PROJECT:
-------------------------------------------
Home security system is a process for improving the quality of residentâ€™s life by facilitating a flexible, comfortable and secure environment. Home security system is the most prominent feature for home automation. Traditional techniques of alarm based security have gained much popularity in past decades. PIC18F452 microcontroller based home security system has been designed without GSM technology. Here, ATMEGA16 microcontroller based home security system with GSM technology has been described. In addition, Bluetooth application has been used to control the system. Consequently, the proposed system provides reliable security within reasonable cost and also removes the circuit complexity
