INTRODUCTION:-
------------------------------------------
 Smart Home automation is a process for improving the quality of residentâ€™s life by facilitating a flexible, comfortable and secure environment. Home security system is the most prominent feature for home automation. Traditional techniques of alarm based security have gained much popularity in past decades. PIC18F452 microcontroller based home security system has been designed without GSM technology. Here, ATMEGA16 microcontroller based home security system with GSM technology has been described. In addition, Bluetooth application has been used to control the system. Consequently, the proposed system provides reliable security within reasonable cost and also removes the circuit complexity

A GSM modem or GSM module is a hardware device that uses GSM mobile telephone technology to provide a data link to a remote network. From the view of the mobile phone network, they are essentially identical to an ordinary mobile phone, including the need for a SIM to identify themselves to the network.
